    <p>"Instagram is a social media platform for sharing photos and short videos, established in 2010 by Michel Krieger and Kevin Systrom"[1].The app was first released for iOS in October 2010 and for Android in April 2012. By June 2018, the number of monthly active users on the platform reached 1 billion. It was purchased by Facebook for $1 billion within two years of its launch. <a href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/instagram-statistics/">(Website)</a></p>

    <p> Instagram was a hit, rapidly gathering users to become one of the world's biggest and most-influential social media platforms. Instagram Stories launched in 2016, which allows users to upload a short series of photos, which are deleted after 24 hours.</p>
        
    <p> Instagram key statistics:- <a href="https://bloggingwizard.com/instagram-statistics-and-facts/">(Webpage)</a></p>

    <p> • "Instagram generated an estimated $51.4 billion revenue in 2022, accounting for almost 45% of Facebook's total revenue".</p>

    <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/en-in/growth-strategies/heres-why-crm-is-important-for-your-business/318988"> <img src="img/CRM.jpeg" alt="this is an image" style="float:right;width:300px;height:200px;"></a>

    <p>Customer Relationship Management (CRM) is a business strategy aimed at enhancing customer satisfaction, loyalty, and advocacy by organizing and streamlining customer interactions. It uses technology and data to create a centralized view of the customer, allowing companies to better understand their needs, preferences, and behavior. By automating sales, marketing, and customer service processes, CRM helps businesses to be more efficient and productive, and to provide an improved customer experience. <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/ca/crm/what-is-crm/">(Website)</a> </p>


    <p>   • “CRM is the largest and fastest-growing enterprise application software category, and worldwide spending on CRM is expected to reach USD $114.4 billion by the year 2027. Though CRM systems have traditionally been used as sales and marketing tools, customer service and support are a rising segment of CRM and a critical piece in managing a holistic customer relationship [2]”. </p>
        
        
    <p>  Case study : KFC has launched a mobile app called the Colonel's Club that allows customers to view the menu, take part in bonus programs, redeem digital coupons, provide feedback, and more. The app uses a point system that rewards customers based on their purchases and provides the company with insights into customer behavior and preferences. This information allows KFC to target customers with limited-time offers on menu items they frequently purchase. The app also encourages customers to visit their closest KFC location and is connected to the point-of-sale technology at outlets, allowing sales teams to communicate with customers through text messages and address them by name.<a href="https://ecinfosolutions.com/blog/crm-for-everyone-kfc-crm/">(Link)</a> </p>
         
    <p>  According to an article published on Destination CRM, the KFC mobile app has shown the following results by 2017: <a href="https://ecinfosolutions.com/blog/crm-for-everyone-kfc-crm/">(Link)</a>
    <p>• 5 percent of the population in participating cities has downloaded the app.</p>
    <p>• 25 percent of customers use the app during their visit to KFC outlets.</p>
    <p>• A high-performing location reported incremental marginal profit of $16,736 in.</p>

    <p>5G technology will play a major role in the advancement of autonomous vehicles. Some of the keyways in which 5G will help make autonomous cars a reality include: <a href="https://www.telekom.com/en/company/details/5g-network-as-foundation-for-autonomous-driving-561986">(Website)</a></p>
        
    <p> 1) Enhanced connectivity: 5G networks will provide much faster and more reliable connectivity than previous generations of mobile networks. This will allow autonomous cars to have more robust communication with each other and with the cloud, enabling real-time data exchange, coordination and decision making.</p> 
        
    <p> 2) Low Latency: 5G networks will have very low latency, meaning the time it takes for data to be transmitted and received will be much shorter. This is crucial for autonomous vehicles, which need to receive and respond to information about their environment in real-time to ensure safe and efficient operation.</p> 

    <p> 3) Increased bandwidth: 5G networks will also have significantly greater bandwidth than previous generations, which will allow autonomous vehicles to receive and transmit large amounts of data. This will be necessary for real-time processing of sensor data from cameras, LiDAR and other sources, as well as for transmitting high-definition maps and other important information.</p> 

    <p> 4) Improved reliability: 5G networks will provide increased reliability and availability, which will be crucial for autonomous vehicles, which will need to operate even in areas with weak or spotty network coverage.</p> 

    <p> Overall, 5G technology will play a critical role in making autonomous vehicles a reality by providing the connectivity, speed, bandwidth, and reliability that these vehicles need to operate safely and effectively. <a href="https://www.telekom.com/en/company/details/5g-network-as-foundation-for-autonomous-driving-561986">(Website)</a></p>

    <a href="https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2019/lessons-from-the-human-genome-project/"><img src="img/HGP.jpg.webp" alt="this is an image" style="float:right;width:300px;height:210px;"></a>
    <p>"The Human Genome Project was an ambitious international research effort with the goal of mapping and sequencing the entire human genome"[3]. The project was officially launched in 1990. It was a collaborative effort among scientists from various countries. <a href="https://www.verslo.is/home/Raungreinar/lif/Itarefni/Liftaekni/Human%20genome%20project(e).htm">(Website)</a></p>
    <p>Human Genome Project (HGP) includes :-</p>

    <p>• Mapping the human genome: Creating a rough map of the genome involved locating the approximate position of all genes on each chromosome, which helped guide further sequencing.</p>

    <p>• Sequencing the genome: Sequencing the human DNA involved determining the precise sequence of base pairs that make up the human genome. This was achieved through a mix of automated and manual sequencing techniques.</p>

    <p>• Assembling the genome: The raw DNA sequence data was then put together to form a complete, continuous genome by merging overlapping data from various parts of the genome.</p>

    <p>• Labeling the genome: The final step was to recognize and label all the genes in the human genome, which required assigning a function to each gene based on its sequence and expression information.</p>

    <p>The Human Genome Project has given many benefits in terms of research and medicines. It has provided a comprehensive reference for the human genome, which has greatly improved our understanding of human biology and genetics. The HGP has paved the way for new genetic tests and therapies for a wide range of diseases, including cancer, heart disease, and inherited genetic disorders. Moreover, it  has contributed to the development of personalized medicine, which shapes medical treatments to the individual needs of patients based on their genetic information and has also provided new insights into human evolution and the diversity of human populations. <a href="https://www.verslo.is/home/Raungreinar/lif/Itarefni/Liftaekni/Human%20genome%20project(e).htm">(Website)</a></p>
